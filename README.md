🔷 Overview
SYMCUBE is a fully documented, formally validated symbolic encryption core designed for post-quantum, AI-resistant security in embedded and military systems. Instead of relying on number-theoretic complexity, SYMCUBE establishes cryptographic resilience through:

Temporal-symbolic unlock sequences

Dynamic environmental mutation (DSMEE)

Formal FSM verification (BMC / NuSMV)

Side-channel mitigation & timing trace obfuscation

Low-power architecture for ARM Cortex-M0+, FPGAs & HSMs

It is not software, but a security framework – intended for direct integration into secure boot chains, tactical memory protection, and post-quantum defense infrastructure.

📁 Contents
This package contains 18 structured documents, grouped as follows:

Section	Description
0–1 Cover & Executive	Cover letter + strategic summary
2–5 Core Architecture	Technical, mathematical & side-channel overview
6–8 Performance & Mutation	Platform specs, use cases, DSMEE module
9–11 Unlock & Topology	Formal unlock lifecycle, IRN logic, symbolic rotation chain
12 Symbol Table	Formal symbol definitions (Ω, ∆, Σ, ↻, etc.)
13–15 Advanced Validations	DSMEE validation, timing smoothing, low-power adaptations

🔒 Security Focus
Quantum-Resistant: No factorization or lattice assumptions

AI-Resistant: Immune to LLM-based inference via non-mathematical symbolic encoding

Tamper-Resistant: Fail-secure design with entropy collapse fallback

Replay-Proof: Unlock sequences are time-bound and entropy-contextual

🛠 Integration Targets
Embedded systems (ARM Cortex-M, STM32, RISC-V)

FPGA platforms (Xilinx, Intel)

Secure enclaves (ARM TrustZone, AMD PSP, Intel ME)

Tactical devices (UAVs, blackboxes, field surveillance)

Critical infrastructure bootloaders
